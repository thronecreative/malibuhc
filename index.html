							<h1>Why we exist.</h1>
							<p>Malibu Hand Crafted is more than a product, it is a lifestyle.  MHC Smooch lip balm embodies the essence of the ocean, the beach, nature's purity and health all in one. One of the many reasons why we exist is because we have found that what goes on the body is just as important as what goes in the body. Thus we have developed MHC Smooch, which is an organic coconut oil based balm. We use the coconut oil because of its nutritional value as well as the euphoric sensation that the flavors of coconut provide while transporting you to the tropics.</p>

							<p>MHC Smooch is a socially and environmentally responsible product of the highest quality because we use only fare trade and organic ingredients </p>
							<p>Taking the time to handcraft our product is what differentiates us from the rest.</p>
							<div class="pull">Your lips deserve better.</div>
							<p>I had a desire to create a high quality lip balm that would not only feel and look good but that would also contain health benefits for your lips.  </p>
							<p>The skin is the biggest organ of the body and it is just as important to fuel the outer body with nutrients, as it is the inside. </p>
							<p>MHC Smooch is made with 5 simple plant based products whose active ingredients can only be found in nature.  
Our ingredients, right down to the packaging are clean, natural and responsible.</p>

						<h1>Who we are.</h1>
						<p>By the early age of 3 years old, my interest in beauty became apparent as I would sit on my mothers vanity table and watch her apply her makeup.  Shortly after, around the age of 4 or 5, I began applying her red lipstick to my lips, cheeks and surrounding areas. The older I became, the more fascinated I became with beauty, specifically with the lips. I developed an interest in anything that I could apply to my lips; i.e. chapstick, lip balm, lip gloss, and lipstick. </p>
						<p>I was inspired by the transformation of lips when applying a touch of shine. From that point on my curiosity to try new products was cultivated and continues until this day.</p>
						<div class="image"><img src="/images/MHC-candice-1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p>Malibu born and raised, I grew up on the beach and developed a love for the ocean. I have traveled and lived in various countries throughout the world and within those experiences I discovered  that I am most in my element when I am near the ocean. The beach has always been a place of natural health and healing. I chose to create a product that would not only be soothing and healthy, but would also transport people to a happy place. (Like the smell of sun tan oil on a warm sunny day)</p>
						<div class="image"><img src="/images/MHC-chuck-candice.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p>My interest in health and diet became elevated with the rise of cancer among my family and friends. I felt that it was important to contribute to a healthy lifestyle and well being, not just for myself, but for the betterment of society as a whole. So I created Malibu Hand Crafted Smooch lip balm and began to experiment with my own formulas using only five simple organic ingredients. With each batch I made sure that the integrity of the product was never compromised. After many attempts of trial and error, I found a winning combination containing the perfect amount of shine and consistency. I began using it and sharing it with my friends and family and now we are excited to share MHC smooch with you. </p>
